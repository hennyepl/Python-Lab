# Long story Short

My name is Henok Lamiso and I am a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Lethbridge, AB, Canada. I always enjoy solving problems, especially using technology. I have 4+ years of experience of coding in C++. Besides that, I am familiar with some of the web development languages, for instance, JS and PHP. But now, I really want to become a great Python programmer, and for that reason, I created this repository to document my transition from C++ to Python.
